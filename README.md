Welcome to my Data Analyst Portfolio!

Having just entered the field of Data Analytics, I would like to showcase the various tools I have gained experience in to collect, organize, and analyze data to make informed business decisions.  I have become proficient in Python, SQL, Excel, Power BI, and Tableau, and have incorporated data analytics techniques like dashboard creation, report writing, data mining, statistics, and critical thinking into various projects.
 
Included are a couple projects that highlight my ability in data analytics using various programming languages such as Python and SQL.  These projects demonstrate my ability to analyze and present data in a clear and visually appealing manner, helping business owners extract valuable insights from large complex data sets, leading to make informed decisions on their business objectives.
